# To allow solargraph to resolve the require paths correctly, add the path
# to the Tools directory of one of your SketchUp installations.
# You also want to add the path to where you have the extension's sources.
# (In this example it would be in a `src` directory relative to .solargraph.yml)
require_paths:
- "/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-cask/Casks/"

# This will load the stubs for the SketchUp API.

# Exclude files that doesn't need to be parsed. Avoids noise and improve performance.
